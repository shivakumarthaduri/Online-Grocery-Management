Online-Grocery-Management

This Python-based Grocery Management System provides a user-friendly interface for managing grocery operations, including user and admin functionalities. Users can register, log in, browse available groceries, add items to their cart, view and manage their cart, and check out to place orders. The system also maintains an order history for each user, ensuring a seamless and personalized shopping experience. The admin module allows administrators to log in, view user orders, and manage the grocery inventory by updating or adding new items, ensuring an up-to-date and efficient system.
Key features include file-based data storage (using JSON files) for users, groceries, carts, and orders, ensuring data persistence without a database. The program uses clear and modular functions to handle operations like loading/saving data, authentication, cart management, and inventory updates. The interface is interactive, guiding users through intuitive menu-driven commands, with error handling for invalid inputs and real-time updates to grocery quantities based on purchases. This system is ideal for small-scale grocery shops looking for a simple yet effective inventory and order management solution.
